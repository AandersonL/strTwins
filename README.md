# StrTwins

StrTwins is a binary analysis tool that is capable to find shared code string references between executables and output in JSON, YAML and Yara. 

## How this works

Code string references refer to direct access in the binary code to the string address itself, that's is great filter to detect which strings are actually used by the binary itself.

So, in other words it means that `strTwins` will look *only* strings that are actually used by the software itself and compute every ocurrencies in all arguments and output only `shared` string between them


## Example 

## json

## yaml

## Yara
